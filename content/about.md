I'm Peter (PÃ©tur). I hold a master's degree in physics and am currently working towards a PhD at the [University of Cambridge](https://cam.ac.uk).

I study the fermiology and exotic quantum phases of quantum materials. My research interests are *emergent quantum phenomena*, *unconventional superconductivity*, *topological magnetism*, and *energy technologies*.

I did my undergraduate and master's course at [Durham University](https://www.durham.ac.uk) where I graduated with a first-class degree. Work I did for my master's thesis led to new insights in magnetic interactions in cubic-chiral materials.
